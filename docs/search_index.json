Open up a new script file in RStudio using Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + N. Set working directory using setwd(). Load tidyverse using library(). Read in the data file SWB.csv using read_csv() or read.csv(). Examine the dataset with glimpse() or View() or `str(). Check that you have 343 rows and 23 columns. Convert marital_status and have_children from integer to factor using factor(). Add value labels to the factors. See the legend below to see how each variable is coded. Use glimpse() or str() to check that the variables are indeed converted to factors. Create a subset of the dataset of only married parents (i.e., married people who have children). Further subset the dataset such that only the variables swls2021_1, swls2021_2, swls2021_3, swls2021_4, and swls2021_5 are in the dataset. You should have 68 rows and 5 columns in this subset. Using this subset, compute the average of swls2021_1, swls2021_2, swls2021_3, swls2021_4, and swls2021_5 for each person. Call this variable swls2021_avg. Create a histogram for swls2021_avg. Just play around with the different functions! Change the bar fill color, change the placement of the ticks on the x-axis, change the range of the x-axis, make the background white, etc. (I just want you to explore and have fun!) Using this subset, get the following summary statistics for swls2021_avg: maximum, minimum, mean, and sd. Check that the maximum is 5.4, the minimum is 2.6, the mean is 4.18, and the sd is 0.707. Find out the number of married parents who have ‘swls2021_avg’ greater than or equal to 4.18. (And no, I’m not asking you to count by hand.) Check that the number is 36. For each step above, put in comments using the # sign so that you know what was done. (e.g., # set working directory, # load packages) When you’re done with the above, copy and paste your R script into a word document. Submit the word document in the eLearn Assignment for 1 point. Note. Answers will be released on eLearn the day after this assignment is due. 5.3 Legend Variable Name Variable Label Value Label pin participant identification number gender gender 0 = male, 1 = female marital_status marital status 1 = married, 2 = divorced, 3 = widowed have_children parental status 0 = no children, 1 = have children mvs_1 My life would be better if I own certain things I don’t have. 1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = neither disagree nor agree, 4 = agree, 5 = strongly agree mvs_2 The things I own say a lot about how well I’m doing. 1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = neither disagree nor agree, 4 = agree, 5 = strongly agree mvs_3 I’d be happier if I could afford to buy more things. 1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = neither disagree nor agree, 4 = agree, 5 = strongly agree mvs_4 It bothers me that I can’t afford to buy things I’d like. 1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = neither disagree nor agree, 4 = agree, 5 = strongly agree mvs_5 Buying things gives me a lot of pleasure. 1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = neither disagree nor agree, 4 = agree, 5 = strongly agree mvs_6 I admire people who own expensive homes, cars, clothes. 1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = neither disagree nor agree, 4 = agree, 5 = strongly agree mvs_7 I like to own things that impress people. 1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = neither disagree nor agree, 4 = agree, 5 = strongly agree mvs_8 I like a lot of luxury in my life. 1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree, 3 = neither disagree nor agree, 4 = agree, 5 = strongly agree mvs_9 I try to keep my life simple, as far as possessions are concerned.

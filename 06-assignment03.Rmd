# Assignment 3 {#tha3}

## Instructions

1. Download the data file here: [WVS2012 Singapore BFI10 Data.csv](WVS2012 Singapore BFI10 Data.csv).This dataset contains the responses of 1972 Singaporean participants to the 10-item Big Five Inventory (BFI10) in the 2012 World Values Survey. The BFI10 uses 2 items to measure each personality trait: extraversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, openness to experience, and neuroticism. One item is positively-keyed and the other is reverse-keyed (R). See the legend below for more information. 
1. Open up a new script file in RStudio. 
1. Set working directory using `setwd()`.
1. Load `tidyverse` and `psych` packages using `library()`.
1. Read in the data file `WVS2012 Singapore BFI10 Data.csv` using `read_csv()` or `read.csv()`.
1. Examine the dataset with `glimpse()` or `View()` or `str()`. Check that you have 1972 rows and 10 columns. 
1. Create a subset of the data by removing all participants who had negative values for any of the BFI10 items (e.g., -5, -2). (Hint: Use the `filter_all()` and `all_vars()` functions from the `dplyr` package. You'll need to read up a bit to figure out how that works.)
1. Reverse-code all the reverse-keyed items (V160A, V160C, V160D, V160E, V160G). 
1. Get the correlation coefficient for each pair of items for the same personality trait. Check that your answer matches mine: r = 0.1177 (extraversion), r = 0.0636 (agreeableness), r = 0.0921 (conscientiousness), r = 0.0478 (neuroticism), and r = -0.2959 (openness to experience). At this point, you should be surprised that openness to experience is negatively related, especially because we had actually re-coded the reverse-keyed items!
1. Get the Cronbach’s alpha for each pair of items for the same personality trait. Check that your answer matches mine: α = 0.21 (extraversion), α = 0.12 (agreeableness), α = 0.17 (conscientiousness), α = 0.09 (neuroticism), and α = ERROR because items were negatively correlated (openness to experience). This suggests that the BFI10 has low reliability for the Singapore data. This mirrors findings elsewhere which suggest that the BFI10 has low reliability for non WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrial, Rich, and Democratic) countries (https://renebekkers.wordpress.com/2017/03/21/hunting-game-targeting-the-big-five/).
1. For each step above, put in comments using the # sign so that you know what was done. (e.g., # set working directory, # load packages)
1. When you’re done with the above, copy and paste your R script into a word document. Submit the word document in the eLearn Assignment for 1 point.

_Note._ Answers will be released on eLearn the day after this assignment is due.

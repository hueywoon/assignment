# Hypothesis Testing {#hypotest}

## Overview

This section guides you through the steps to conduct the various hypothesis tests we cover in class.

We will use the hypothetical dataset that I introduced in the previous section. Please download the dataset to follow along here: [SWB.csv](SWB.csv). 

## One-Sample T Test

We use a one-sample t test when we want to compare the data from one group to some hypothesized mean. So, let's say we're interested to know whether parents are more satisfied with their lives than our neutral value of 4.  

```{r}

t.test(data$swls2019_avg, alternative = c("two.sided"), mu = 4, paired = FALSE, conf.level = 0.95)

```

## Correlated Groups T Test

## Independent Groups T Test

## One-Way Between-Subjects ANOVA

## Two-Way Between-Subjects ANOVA

## Correlation

## Regression
